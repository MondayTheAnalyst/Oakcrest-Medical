# 📊 Results and Insights – Oakcrest Medical Dashboard

This document presents the full analytical insights derived from a fictional healthcare dashboard built in Power BI. The visuals and metrics simulate operational data from **Oakcrest Medical**, a placeholder for a real private hospital where I volunteered as a data analyst. The insights span from **2022 to 2025** and are categorized into three areas: **Admissions**, **Procedures**, and **Billings**.
